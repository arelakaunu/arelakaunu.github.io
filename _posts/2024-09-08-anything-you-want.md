Derek Sivers' *Anything You Want* offers some unconventional yet powerful insights into business and life. Here are the key takeaways that stood out to me:

### Persistence, but with Purpose
Persistence is often seen as the key to success, but Sivers suggests it’s not just about persisting with what's not working. Instead, persistently improve and invent. If something isn’t gaining traction, don’t keep pushing it as it is—adapt, refine, and innovate. After all, there's no point in fighting uphill battles against locked doors.

### The Power of "Hell Yeah!" or "No"
Sivers encourages us to adopt a "Hell yeah!" or "no" approach to decisions. By saying "no" to most things, you make room to fully commit to the opportunities that genuinely excite you. It’s a refreshing way to avoid spreading yourself too thin.

### Embrace Change
One of the standout quotes from the book is,

> No plan survives first contact with customers.

It’s a reminder to be flexible and ready to adapt as your business or project evolves.

### The Perks of No Funding
Without a pile of cash, you’re forced to focus on what truly matters: your customers. The lack of funding can actually be an advantage, as it prevents you from wasting money and keeps your priorities aligned with customer needs. Sivers even argues that you don’t need funding to start; you just need to start, and let your customers guide your growth.

### Execution Over Ideas
A brilliant idea is worthless without execution. Even a mediocre idea, when executed well, can be far more valuable. It’s a simple but powerful reminder that action trumps everything.

### Reject Fear-Driven Formalities
As your business grows, resist the urge to get bogged down by unnecessary formalities driven by fear, like over-complicated terms and conditions. Instead, focus on what truly matters—delivering value to your customers.

### Small Customers, Big Freedom
Many new businesses dream of landing a big client like Apple or Google, but this can come at a cost. Tailoring your product to the whims of a single client can make them your de facto boss. Instead, Sivers advocates for focusing on many smaller clients, which gives you more freedom and less dependency on any one customer.

### Embrace Exclusion
You can’t please everyone, and that’s okay. In fact, confidently excluding some people can win you the hearts of those who truly resonate with what you offer. When you’re unapologetic about who you are, your target audience will appreciate it even more.

### Ditch Advertising
Sivers challenges the conventional wisdom of plastering websites with ads. If your business exists to genuinely help people, then focus on that, not on squeezing out extra revenue from ads.

### It's About Being, Not Having
Finally, Sivers emphasises that it’s about who you want to be, not what you want to have. Whether it’s learning a new skill or running a business, the journey itself should bring you joy, not just the end goal.

### Conclusion
*Anything You Want* is a reminder that business and life are what you make of them. It’s about doing things on your terms, staying true to what excites you, and not getting lost in the noise of conventional wisdom. For anyone looking to carve out their own path, Sivers' advice is invaluable.
