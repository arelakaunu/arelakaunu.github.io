## The people behind BioGO

BioGO is born from the combined ideas and efforts of a teaching team from the University catholique de Louvain:

### Guillaume Lobet
Guillaume Lobet is an Assistant Professor, between the Forschungszentrum Jülich (IBG3, Agrosphere) and the Université catholique de Louvain (Earth and Life Institute). The aim of Guillaume’s research is (i) to understand how various signals that carry information are interacting and being conveyed and integrated at the plant level and (ii) to amplify discrete physiological knowledge into functional plant processes. All of that using Functional Structural Plant Models. More about Guillaume’s research can be found at [www.guillaumelobet.be](www.guillaumelobet.be).
